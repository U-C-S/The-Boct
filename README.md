BOcT is a Static Browser Chatbot, made with TypeScript. It's currently in Lazy development

New Feature: BOcT can now convert units

Also, Available as Progressive Web App (PWA)

Future Updates to BOcT can make it perform basic Maths, Maybe suggest you some Movies...

98% Self-Made. Also, This is my Self-Learning JavaScript and TypeScript Project (learning from MDN)

Note: This is quite Over-Polished and gets polishing done time to time;
